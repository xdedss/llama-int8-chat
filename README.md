Llama chat: 基于llama的聊天模式

通过prompt设计让模型能够用于对话（见example.py）

环境配置方法和和原readme相同，使用时运行

``` python
python example.py --ckpt_dir xxxx/13B --tokenizer_path xxxx/tokenizer.model
```

等待加载完后出现`>`字符即可开始输入。

13B模型在单张3090上占用16G显存

# LLaMA: INT8 edition

This is a fork of the LLaMA code that runs LLaMA-13B
comfortably within 24 GiB of RAM.
It relies almost entirely on the `bitsandbytes` and `LLM.int8()` work of Tim Dettmers.
I've tested it on an RTX 4090, and it [reportedly works on the 3090](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/issues/79#issuecomment-1454687232). It might also theoretically allow us to run LLaMA-65B on an 80GB A100, but I haven't tried this.

The code contains the following changes:

- Removes parallelism constructs
- Quantizes weights on the host machine
- Loads weights incrementally to avoid severe memory problems
- Added dependencies on `bitsandbytes`, `tqdm`.
- Repetition penalty settings (`--repetition_penalty`, default 1.15)

On my Ubuntu machine with 64 GB of RAM and an RTX 4090, it takes about 25 seconds to load in the floats and quantize the model.
Users should be ready to expand their swapfiles if they don't have enough RAM.
Llamanon has also produced a [slightly uncouth user's guide](https://rentry.org/llama-tard) for using this repo, which I won't reproduce here but seems generally trustworthy.
[You will likely need to build `bitsandbytes` from source.](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/blob/main/compile_from_source.md)

## Usage:

`python example.py --ckpt_dir [TARGET_DIR]/13B --tokenizer_path [TARGET_DIR]/tokenizer.model --max_batch_size=1`

# Original README

This repository is intended as a minimal, hackable and readable example to load [LLaMA](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/) ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971v1)) models and run inference.
In order to download the checkpoints and tokenizer, fill this [google form](https://forms.gle/jk851eBVbX1m5TAv5)

### Setup

In a conda env with pytorch / cuda available, run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then in this repository

```
pip install -e .
```

### Download

Once your request is approved, you will receive links to download the tokenizer and model files.
Edit the `download.sh` script with the signed url provided in the email to download the model weights and tokenizer.

### Inference

The provided `example.py` can be run on a single or multi-gpu node with `torchrun` and will output completions for two pre-defined prompts. Using `TARGET_FOLDER` as defined in `download.sh`:

```
torchrun --nproc_per_node MP example.py --ckpt_dir $TARGET_FOLDER/model_size --tokenizer_path $TARGET_FOLDER/tokenizer.model
```

Different models require different MP values:

| Model | MP  |
| ----- | --- |
| 7B    | 1   |
| 13B   | 2   |
| 33B   | 4   |
| 65B   | 8   |
